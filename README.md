## Discussion on Cases in Automata Zoo
### (To deprecate) EntityResolution

EntityResolution generates automata from the 10,000 names with fuzzy, using the following pattern.

"<Last Name w/ fuzzy> *, +<First Name w/ fuzzy>"

The fuzzy rule is 1 letter mismatch allowance in each of the laste name and first name substring.

This does not seem a good regex task to me and should better be implemented on GPU using a specific kernel that counts mismatch.
